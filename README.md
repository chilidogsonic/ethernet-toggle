## 🎮 Usage Guide

### Quick Start

1. **Find the icon** in your system tray (notification area, bottom-right corner)
   - 🟢 **Green icon** = Network enabled (at least one adapter is active)
   - 🔴 **Red icon** = Network disabled (all adapters are off)
   - ⏳ **Timer icon** = Temporary disable mode (will auto-restore)

2. **Quick Actions:**
   - **Left-click** the icon → Instantly toggle all network adapters on/off
   - **Right-click** the icon → Open full menu with advanced options

### Menu Options (Right-Click)

- **Toggle Network (On/Off)** - Enable or disable ALL network adapters
- **Disable for 1/2/5/30/60 minutes** - Temporary disable with automatic restore
- **Cancel Timer** - Stop countdown and restore network immediately
- **Quit** - Exit the application

### Timer Feature

When you select a timer option:
1. All network adapters are immediately disabled
2. The tray icon changes to the ⏱️ timer icon
3. **Hover over the icon** to see a live countdown (e.g., "Network: Disabled (Re-enabling in 4m 32s)")
4. The network automatically restores when the timer expires
5. You can click "Cancel Timer" or manually toggle to restore early

### Tips

- **Keyboard shortcuts:** Not currently supported, but you can assign a hotkey to the executable via Windows properties
- **Multiple adapters:** The app detects and controls ALL physical Ethernet and WiFi adapters simultaneously
- **Virtual adapters:** VPN, Hyper-V, and other virtual adapters are excluded from control
- **Administrator required:** The app must run with admin privileges to control network adapters

## 🔧 For Developers

### System Requirements

   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   # Open Command Prompt or PowerShell as Administrator
   python network_kill_switch.py
   ```

   The app will appear in your system tray.

### Building from Source

Want to build your own installer? See [BUILD.md](BUILD.md) for detailed instructions.

**Quick Build:**
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Build the standalone EXE and installer
build_installer.bat
```

**Output:**
- Standalone EXE: `dist\NetworkKillSwitch.exe`
- Windows Installer: `Output\NetworkKillSwitch-Setup.exe`

### Build Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- [Inno Setup 6](https://jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php) (for creating the installer)
- PyInstaller (automatically installed by build script)

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary><b>"Could not find network adapter" error</b></summary>

**Solution:**
- The app looks for physical Ethernet and WiFi adapters using specific naming patterns
- Virtual adapters (VPN, Hyper-V, VMware, VirtualBox) are intentionally excluded
- Check your adapter names in **Device Manager** → **Network adapters**
- If your adapter has an unusual name, you may need to modify the detection logic in `network_kill_switch.py` (line 131)
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Toggle doesn't work / No effect when clicking</b></summary>

**Solution:**
1. **Verify administrator privileges:**
   - Press `Ctrl+Shift+Esc` to open Task Manager
   - Find `NetworkKillSwitch.exe` in the Details tab
   - Check if "Elevated" column shows "Yes"
   - If not, right-click the app shortcut → "Run as administrator"

2. **Check Windows Event Viewer:**
   - Press `Win+X` → Event Viewer
   - Navigate to **Windows Logs** → **System**
   - Look for errors related to network adapter operations

3. **Test PowerShell commands manually:**
   - Open PowerShell as Administrator
   - Run: `Get-NetAdapter` (should list your adapters)
   - Run: `Disable-NetAdapter -Name "Ethernet" -Confirm:$false` (replace "Ethernet" with your adapter name)
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Auto-startup not working</b></summary>

**Solution:**
1. **Check Task Scheduler:**
   - Press `Win+R` → type `taskschd.msc` → Enter
   - Look for a task named **"NetworkKillSwitchApp"**
   - Right-click → **Properties** → Verify:
     - Trigger: "At log on"
     - Action: Points to correct EXE path
     - "Run with highest privileges" is checked

2. **Run diagnostic script:**
   - Navigate to installation folder: `C:\Program Files\Network Kill Switch`
   - Right-click `check_task_permissions.ps1` → "Run with PowerShell"
   - Review the diagnostic output

3. **Manual setup:**
   - Right-click `setup_task_silent.ps1` in the installation folder
   - Select "Run with PowerShell"
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Icon doesn't appear in system tray</b></summary>

**Solution:**
1. **Check if app is running:**
   - Open Task Manager (`Ctrl+Shift+Esc`)
   - Look for `NetworkKillSwitch.exe` under "Background processes"

2. **Check overflow area:**
   - Click the **^** arrow in your system tray (hidden icons)
   - The icon might be collapsed there

3. **Restart the application:**
   - Kill the process in Task Manager
   - Relaunch from Start Menu or installation folder
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>App shows "Loading..." indefinitely</b></summary>

**Solution:**
- This usually indicates PowerShell commands are timing out
- Check your antivirus software isn't blocking PowerShell execution
- Try running as Administrator
- Verify PowerShell execution policy: `Get-ExecutionPolicy` (should be at least RemoteSigned)
</details>

## 🛠️ Technical Architecture

### Technology Stack

| Component | Technology | Purpose |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| **Language** | Python 3.7+ | Core application logic |
| **UI Framework** | [pystray](https://github.com/moses-palmer/pystray) | System tray integration and menu |
| **Image Processing** | [Pillow (PIL)](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/) | Icon rendering and manipulation |
| **Network Control** | Windows PowerShell | Native adapter enable/disable commands |
| **Packaging** | [PyInstaller](https://pyinstaller.org/) | Standalone EXE compilation |
| **Installer** | [Inno Setup](https://jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php) | Windows installer creation |

### How It Works

1. **Adapter Detection:**
   - Uses PowerShell's `Get-NetAdapter` cmdlet to enumerate physical network adapters
   - Filters for Ethernet and WiFi adapters (excludes virtual adapters like VPN, Hyper-V)
   - Supports multiple adapters simultaneously

2. **State Management:**
   - Monitors adapter status using `Get-NetAdapter | Select-Object Status`
   - Real-time status verification after each toggle operation
   - Tooltip updates every second during timer countdown

3. **Toggle Operation:**
   - Executes PowerShell commands: `Enable-NetAdapter` / `Disable-NetAdapter`
   - Runs in background thread to avoid UI blocking
   - Visual feedback with animated loading indicator

4. **Timer Function:**
   - Spawns dedicated background thread for countdown
   - Updates tooltip every second with formatted time remaining
   - Automatically re-enables adapters when timer expires

5. **Administrator Privileges:**
   - Embedded UAC manifest (`uac_admin=True` in PyInstaller spec)
   - Automatically prompts for elevation on launch
   - Gracefully handles non-admin scenarios with warnings
